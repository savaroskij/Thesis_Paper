\section*{\centering Abstract}

My master thesis concerns the formulation and validation of a statistical
model of atmospheric emission in the context of ground-based observations
of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB).
\\\\
The cosmic microwave background radiation is a relic signal composed of
photons that were involved in Thomson scattering events occurring in the
primordial plasma until the recombination epoch, about \num{380000} years
after the Big Bang, and have been propagated in the expanding Universe
since then.

The characterization of the polarized component of the CMB signal is one of
the most important goals in observational cosmology. The so called
\emph{B-modes}, the curl component of the CMB polarization field, are
thought to have been generated by gravitational waves propagating in the
primordial Universe. The presence of primordial gravitational waves is one
of the prediction of the inflationary paradigm.

The predicted intensity of the B-modes signal is at the level of fraction
of \si{\micro\kelvin}. Therefore, its detection requires the development of
experiments characterized by extremely high sensitivity. In addition, the
sky signal in the CMB frequency range is dominated by other brighter
radiations, such as galactic foregrounds and atmospheric emission.

Atmospheric effects represents a major concern for ground-based CMB
polarization experiments. Despite being almost unpolarized, atmospheric
emission increases optical loading on the detectors, amplifying their white
noise level. In addition, its fluctuations, which depend on both the sky
scanning strategy and the properties of the atmosphere at time of
observations, such as wind speed and water vapour content, introduce
spatial and temporal correlations between detected signals.

In my thesis I present a novel approach to produce a statistical model of
atmospheric emission, starting from climate reanalysis provided by the
\emph{European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts} and atmospheric
vertical profiles acquired by balloon probes. This model can be used
to simulate the atmospheric brightness temperature (TATM) and its seasonal
variations at an arbitrary observation site. It can be stored in a
\num{\sim 2} MB \texttt{.fits} file and can be easily integrated into
simulation pipelines for CMB experiments.

I compare my numerical results with atmospheric brightness temperatures
measured during the years 2012-2015 by the \emph{Multi-Frequency
Instrument} (MFI) of the QUIJOTE project, which have been deployed to the
``Observatorio del Teide'', in Tenerife by the ``Instituto de
Astrof\'fisica de Canarias''. Through the use of a calibration technique
based on atmospheric vertical profiles acquired at ``Pico del Teide'', I
obtain simulated values of TATM at \SIlist{11;13;17;19}{\giga\hertz}, which
are compatible with MFI data at a \SI{95}{\percent} confidence level.

In addition, I produce a forecast of the median daily and annual excursion
of atmospheric brightness temperature at \SI{43}{\giga\hertz} for the
Q-band polarimeters of the Strip telescope of the \emph{Large Scale
Polarization Explorer} experiment. This project has been funded by the
\emph{Italian Space Agency} and aims to provide a smaller upper limit to
the intensity of B-modes.  \textcolor{red}{(Trovo molto complicato
introdurre qui il tensor-to-scalar-ratio, pu\o` andar bene quello che ho
scritto?i)}.  The Strip telescope is currently under testing
\textcolor{red}{(All'UNIBO?)} and will join the QUIJOTE MFI, TGI and FGI
telescopes at the Observatorio del Teide by the end of 2022.
