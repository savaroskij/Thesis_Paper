\chapter{The Atmospheric Statistical Picture}\label{ch:statistical_picture}

In this chapter a method to build a \emph{statistical picture} of the
atmosphere is presented. First the ERA5 dataset is introduced: this
constitutes the set of statistical populations for the relevant meteorological
parameters that we have choosen to achieve this result; then the statistical
picture of the atmosphere is defined and the described in details; finally,
the mathematical objects we have used to describe expected daily and annual
variations of meteorological parameters at Pico del Teide are analyzed.

These results form the basis to get an estimate of the atmosphere
brightness temperature in the microwave range. This contribution, and its
seasonal variations as well, will be studied in the following chapters.

\section{The ERA5 Dataset}

As we have discussed in \autoref{ch:atm_model}, to calculate the extra load
caused by atmospheric effects, we must solve the radiative transfer equation
in the case of a dispersive medium at local thermodynamic equilibrium. The
solution depends on the physical properties of the medium. In particular,
it is determined by its physical temperature, $T$, and absorption
coefficient, $\alpha_\nu$. In turn, these quantities depends on a set a
meteorological parameters, which undergo seasonal variations.

In order to create a reliable statistical representation of these daily and
annual variations, we employed the ERA-5 dataset by the \emph{European
Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts} (ECMWF). ECMWF uses forecast
models and data assimilation systems to \emph{reanalyse} archived
meteorological observations, creating global datasets describing the
recent history of the atmosphere, land surface, and oceans. In particular,
ERA5 provides hourly estimates of a large number of atmospheric, land and
oceanic climate variables. The data cover the whole Earth surface and
resolve the atmosphere using \num{137} levels from the surface up to a
height of \SI{80}{\kilo\meter}. ERA5 reanalysis relies on the \emph{Global
Circulation Model} (GCM) algorithm (McGuffie, Henderson-Sellers) making use
of the historical measures as forcing terms into GCM simulations to produce
data homogeneously gridded characterized by high spatial and temporal
resolution.

\autoref{fig:pwv_canary_islands} shows PWV distribution from ERA5 dataset
in Canary Island for the twelfth hour of the first day of the 1980. The
archipelago in covered by a grid of \num{30} by \num{30} \si{\kilo\meter}
\emph{pixels}  (\ang{0.25} by \ang{0.25} in geographic coordinate system).
As expected, precipitable water vapour takes its lowest values for
continental lands, its greatest values for pixels covering ocean and
intermediate values in correspondence of islands. \autoref{fig:pwv_tenerife}
focuses on Tenerife islands, showing that the whole site is covered by only four
pixels, which are delimited by a fuchsia perimeter in the figure.
In the following chapters we will prove that ERA5 spatial
resolution is in fact not enough to describe the specific meteorological
conditions at Pico del Teide, and at observation sites found on
small islands in general.

\subsection{The Set of Relevant Meteorological Parameters}

Climate reanalysis data ranging from January the 1th 1979 to November
the 21th 2020 have been acquired by means of the ECMWF Web API, for a total of
\num{367200} hours in UTC. Downloaded data concern only one of the pixels found in
\autoref{fig:pwv_tenerife}: the one including the territory of Teide
observatory, which in the figure is enclosed by a yellow
square.

The relevant parameters, essential to provide a complete description of our
atmosphere, have been selected, for a total of seven quantities:

\begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{total column cloud liquid water} (\textbf{tclw}):

        the amount of liquid water contained within cloud
        droplets in a column extending from the surface of the Earth to the
        top of the atmosphere, measure in \si{\kilo\gram\per\square\meter}.
        Rain water droplets, which are much larger
        in size (and mass), are not included in this parameter;

        \item \textbf{total column cloud ice water} (\textbf{tciw}):

        the amount of ice contained within clouds in a column extending
        from the surface of the Earth to the top of the atmosphere,
        measured in \si{\kilo\gram\per\square\meter}. Snow
        (aggregated ice crystals) is not included in this parameter;

        \item \textbf{total column water vapour} (\textbf{tcwv}) or \textbf{precipitable
        water vapour} (\textbf{PWV}):

        the total amount of water vapour in a column
        extending from the surface of the Earth to the top of the
        atmosphere, measured in \si{\kilo\gram\per\square\meter};

        \item \textbf{skin temperature} (\textbf{skt}):

        the temperature of the surface of the Earth, measured in
        \si{\kelvin};

        \item \textbf{surface pressure} (\textbf{sp}):

        the pressure of the atmosphere on the surface of land, sea and
        in-land water, measured in \si{\pascal};

        \item \textbf{10 meter temperature} (\textbf{T10M}):

        this parameter is not present in the ERA5 database, then it has
        been deduced from the \emph{2 meter temperature} (2t) parameter
        assuming a linear decrease in troposphere temperature of
        \SI{6.5e-3}{\kelvin\per\meter}. The 2t parameter represents the
        temperature of air at \SI{2}{\meter} above the surface of land, sea
        or in-land waters;

        \item \textbf{10 meter V wind component} (\textbf{10v}):

        the northward component of the 10m wind. It is the horizontal speed
        of air moving towards the north, at a height of ten meters above
        the surface of the Earth, measured in \si{\meter\per\second};

        \item \textbf{10 meter U wind component} (\textbf{10u}):

        like the latter parameter, but for the eastward component of the
        wind speed.
\end{itemize}

The totality of these meteorological parameters is necessary to describe
atmospheric radiative contribution and spatial structures. However, the
skin temperature ($T_s$), the surface pressure ($P_s)$ and the precipitable
water vapour (PWV) are enough to provide a first estimate of the extra
white noise load on detectors.
